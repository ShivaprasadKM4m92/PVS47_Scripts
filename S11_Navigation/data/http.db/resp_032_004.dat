Since ALT and AST lack liver specificity, the diagnosis of the onset of hepatocellular injury in patients with underlying muscle impairments is severely limited. Thus, we evaluated the potential of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) as a liver specific alternative biomarker of hepatocellular injury. In our study, serum GLDH in subjects with Duchene muscular dystrophy (DMD) was equivalent to serum GLDH in age matched healthy subjects, while serum ALT was increased 20-fold in DMD subjects. Furthermore, serum GLDH in 131 subjects with variety of muscle impairments was similar to serum GLDH of healthy subjects while serum ALT corelated with serum creatine kinase, a widely accepted biomarker of muscle impairment. In addition, significant elevations of ALT, AST, and CK were observed in a case of a patient with rhabdomyolysis, while serum GLDH stayed within the normal range until the onset of hypoxia-induced liver injury. In a mouse model of DMD (DMDmdx), serum GLDH but not serum ALT clearly correlated with the degree of acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Taken together, our data support the utility of serum GLDH as a liver-specific biomarker of liver injury that has a potential to improve diagnosis of hepatocellular injury in patients with underlying muscle impairments. In drug development, GLDH may have utility as a biomarker of drug induced liver injury in clinical trials of new therapies to treat muscle diseases such as DMD.","execConfigId":8633,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":8680,"alertName":"PerfTest4","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Real-time monitoring and accurate diagnosis of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo by ratio-fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging of peroxynitrite.","authors":"[Hongjun, Zhuang][Benhao, Li][Mengyao, Zhao][Peng, Wei][Wei, Yuan][Mengfan, Zhang][Xuemin, Han][Yin, Chen][Tao, Yi]","assignedTo":{"id":6578,"fullName":"Admin","name":"Admin"},"publicationDate":"14-May-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"PARACETAMOL","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":8602,"articleId":"32356536","articleAbstract":"Because of the low tissue penetration depth and poor photostability of organic cyanine dye, in addition to environmental interference, it is a great challenge to monitor the degree of drug-induced hepatotoxicity by the in vivo detection of peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Herein, we fabricated heptamethine cyanine dye (P-cy7)-coordinated upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), namely UCY7, as a fluorescent nanoprobe for evaluating drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Due to the luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) between UCNPs and the cyanine dye (P-cy7), the irradiation changed from visible light at 660 nm to near infrared (NIR) light at 980 nm; therefore, the issues of poor photostability and severe photobleaching of cyanine dye can be effectively solved. After injecting via the tail vein, the nanoprobes are rapidly concentrated in the liver. Since the level of ONOO- is up-regulated during the drug-induced liver injury, the LRET between UCNPs and P-cy7 is disrupted to release the upconversion luminescence at 656 nm, while the upconversion luminescence at 800 nm remains constant, thus achieving the ratio-fluorescent imaging (RFLI) of ONOO- in the liver to calibrate the influence of the environment. In addition, the reduction in the absorption of nanoprobes in the presence of ONOO- allows for sensitive photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Based on the RFLI and PAI of the liver, the real-time monitoring and accurate diagnosis of different degrees of hepatotoxicity using the model of Acetaminophen (APAP) induction was achieved successfully, providing a new approach for the clinical evaluation of drug-induced hepatotoxicity.","execConfigId":8633,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":8678,"alertName":"PerfTest4","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Murine iNKT cells are depleted by liver damage via activation of P2RX7.","authors":"[Astrid A, Bovens][Thomas H, Wesselink][Felix M, Behr][Natasja A M, Kragten][René A W, van Lier][Klaas P J M, van Gisbergen][Regina, Stark]","assignedTo":{"id":6578,"fullName":"Admin","name":"Admin"},"publicationDate":"10-May-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"PARACETAMOL","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":8602,"articleId":"32390174","articleAbstract":"Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) constitute up to 50% of liver lymphocytes and contribute to immunosurveillance as well as pathogenesis of the liver. Systemic activation of iNKT cells induces acute immune-mediated liver injury. However, how tissue damage events regulate iNKT cell function and homeostasis remains unclear. We found that specifically tissue-resident iNKT cells in liver and spleen express the tissue-damage receptor P2RX7 and the P2RX7-activating ectoenzyme ARTC2. P2RX7 expression restricted formation of iNKT cells in the liver suggesting that liver iNKT cells are actively restrained under homeostatic conditions. Deliberate activation of P2RX7 in vivo by exogenous NAD resulted in a nearly complete iNKT cell ablation in liver and spleen in a P2RX7-dependent manner. Tissue damage generated by acetaminophen-induced liver injury reduced the number of iNKT cells in the liver. The tissue-damage-induced iNKT cell depletion was driven by P2RX7 and localized to the site of injury, as iNKT cells in the spleen remained intact. The depleted liver iNKT cells reconstituted only slowly compared to other lymphocytes such as regulatory T cells. These findings suggest that tissue-damage-mediated depletion of iNKT cells acts as a feedback mechanism to limit iNKT cell-induced pathology resulting in the establishment of a tolerogenic environment.

The different characteristics of the pore structure of such formulations influence the liquid transport through the tablet and hence affect the disintegration time and the release of the drug in the body. In this work, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and terahertz pulsed imaging were used as promising analytical techniques to quantitatively analyse the impact of the structural properties on the liquid uptake and swelling rates upon contact with the dissolution medium. Both the impact of porosity and formulation were investigated for theophylline and paracetamol based tablets. The drug substances were either formulated with functionalised calcium carbonate (FCC) with porosities of 45% and 60% or with microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) with porosities of 10% and 25%. The terahertz results reveal that the rate of liquid uptake is clearly influenced by the porosity of the tablets with a faster liquid transport observed for tablets with higher porosity, indicating that the samples exhibit structural similarity in respect to pore connectivity and pore size distribution characteristics in respect to permeability. The swelling of the FCC based tablets is fully controlled by the amount of disintegrant, whereas the liquid uptake is driven by the FCC material and the interparticle pores created during compaction. The MCC based formulations are more complex as the MCC significantly contributes to the overall tablet swelling. An increase in swelling with increasing porosity is observed in these tablets, which indicates that such formulations are performance-limited by their ability to take up liquid. Investigating the effect of the microstructure characteristics on the liquid transport and swelling kinetics is of great importance for reaching the next level of understanding of the drug delivery, and, depending on the surface nature of the pore carrier function, in turn controlling the performance of the drug mainly in respect to dissolution in the body.","execConfigId":8633,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":8674,"alertName":"PerfTest4","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"In vivo assessment of the drug interaction between sorafenib and paracetamol in rats.","authors":"[Agnieszka, Karbownik][Katarzyna, Sobańska][Tomasz, Grabowski][Joanna, Stanisławiak-Rudowicz][Anna, Wolc][Edmund, Grześkowiak][Edyta, Szałek]","assignedTo":{"id":6578,"fullName":"Admin","name":"Admin"},"publicationDate":"11-May-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"PARACETAMOL","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":8602,"articleId":"32394097","articleAbstract":"Sorafenib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and radioactive iodine resistant thyroid carcinoma.

Numerous studies have pointed out changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of TKIs when co-administered with paracetamol. The aim of the study was to assess drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between sorafenib and paracetamol.Rats were divided into three groups, each consisting of eight animals.

A single dose of sorafenib (100 mg/kg b.w.) and paracetamol (100 mg/kg b.w.) was administered orally. The plasma concentrations of sorafenib and its metabolite-N-oxide as well as paracetamol and its glucuronide and sulphate metabolites were measured using validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet detection.The co-administration of sorafenib and paracetamol increased the maximum concentration (Cmax) of paracetamol by 33% (p = 0.0372).

Repeated monitoring of urine chemistries aids in the diagnosis of the etiology underlying hyponatremia, including fever, in patients with transient ADH secretion. Glucocorticoid administration suppresses ADH secretion and improves hyponatremia even in the absence of adrenal insufficiency; the etiology of hyponatremia should be determined carefully in these patients.","execConfigId":8633,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":8673,"alertName":"PerfTest4","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Subarachnoid block and ultrasound-guided transversalis fascia plane block for caesarean section: A randomised placebo-controlled double-blind study.","authors":"[Muhammed E, Aydin][Zehra, Bedir][Ahmet M, Yayik][Erkan C, Celik][İrem, Ates][Elif O, Ahiskalioglu][Ali, Ahiskalioglu]","assignedTo":{"id":6578,"fullName":"Admin","name":"Admin"},"publicationDate":"14-May-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"PARACETAMOL","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":8602,"articleId":"32412986","articleAbstract":"After caesarean section, maternal postoperative comfort is critical to allow the new mother to care for her baby.

However, patients in several specific populations can have an increased exposure to toxic APAP metabolites. Therefore, APAP-protein adducts have been proposed as an alternative marker for the assessment of APAP intoxications and as an effective tool to study and steer APAP treatment in patients with an increased risk of APAP-induced liver damage. These adducts have been determined in plasma or serum as a matrix. Blood microsampling allows the determination of a variety of analytes, including protein adducts, in a drop of blood, facilitating convenient follow-up of patients in a home-sampling context, as well as repeated sampling of pediatric patients. We therefore evaluated the use of blood-based volumetric microsamples for the quantification of APAP-protein adducts. Quantitative methods for the determination of APAP-protein adducts in dried blood and dried plasma volumetric absorptive microsamples were developed and validated. Also a preliminary evaluation of pediatric patient dried blood microsamples was conducted. Method validation encompassed the evaluation of selectivity, carry over, calibration model, accuracy and precision, matrix effect, recovery and the effect of the hematocrit on the recovery, dilution integrity, and stability. All pre-set acceptance criteria were met, except for stability. Spiking of blank blood with APAP revealed a concentration-dependent ex vivo formation of APAP-protein adducts, resulting in a response for the measurand APAP-Cys, with an apparent role for the red blood cell fraction. Analysis of authentic samples, following intake of APAP at therapeutic dosing, revealed much higher APAP-Cys concentrations in dried blood vs. dried plasma samples, making interpretation of the results in the context of published intervals difficult. In addition, in contrast to what was observed during method validation, the data obtained for the patient samples showed a high and unacceptable variation. We conclude that, for a combination of reasons, dried blood is not a suitable matrix for the quantification of APAP-protein adducts via the measurement of the APAP-Cys digestion product. The collection of plasma or serum, either in the form of a liquid sample or a dried microsample for this purpose is advised.","execConfigId":8633,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":8664,"alertName":"PerfTest4","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Removal of emerging pollutants in aqueous phase by heterogeneous Fenton and photo-Fenton with Fe2O3-TiO2-clay heterostructures.","authors":"[Carmen B, Molina][Eva, Sanz-Santos][Ali, Boukhemkhem][Jorge, Bedia][Carolina, Belver][Juan J, Rodriguez]","assignedTo":{"id":6578,"fullName":"Admin","name":"Admin"},"publicationDate":"16-May-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"PARACETAMOL","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":8602,"articleId":"32418101","articleAbstract":"Fe2O3-TiO2-clay heterostructures have been prepared using an organo-bentonite as support, which organophilic character favored the fixation of TiO2.

Indeed, the composition of the tablets covers a wide range of interferents which can be even unknown. As a consequence, we propose to determine the concentration of an analyte of interest regardless of the interferents using the concept of universal calibration. Universal calibration paves the way to the quantification of a specific chemical entity in samples with various compositions and different interferents. This is possible by the trilinear structure of analyte's signal. In fact, the second-order advantage resulting from the second-order universal calibration models is exploited. However, a new second-order calibration strategy was conducted in this work using Trilinear Factor Extraction (TFE). A simulated data set was exemplified to highlight the ability of the proposed procedure in order to accurate extraction of the analyte's concentration profile. Additionally, two real data sets were also explored in order to test the TFE method. In the first case, Acetaminophen was quantified using fluorescence spectroscopy in tablets with different formulations from 6 companies. In the second experimental data, a peptide (Valine-Tyrosine-Valine) was successfully quantified in different samples using spectrofluorimetric data. Finally, these real data sets were analyzed by Multivariate Curve resolution - Alternating Least-Squares (MCR-ALS) under non-negativity and trilinearity constraints for the sake of comparison. The calculated Root Mean Square Error of Predictions (RMSEP) of Acetaminophen were 0.028 and 0.026 for the MCR-ALS and TFE models, respectively. On the other hand, for the second experimental data set, the RMSEP were 0.216 and 0.165, respectively. Finally, based on a paired t-test, the results of MCR-ALS and TFE were not significantly different.","execConfigId":8633,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":8661,"alertName":"PerfTest4","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Nature and nurture of sexual partner preference: Teachings from prenatal administration of acetaminophen in male rats.","authors":"[X, Díaz-Estrada Victor][M, Barradas-Moctezuma][D, Herrera-Covarrubias][J, Manzo][A, Coria-Avila Genaro]","assignedTo":{"id":6578,"fullName":"Admin","name":"Admin"},"publicationDate":"15-May-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"PARACETAMOL","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":8602,"articleId":"32422195","articleAbstract":"The organizational-activational hypothesis indicates that activation of adult sexual behavior in males depends on organization of the masculine brain during the perinatal sensitive period.

Thus, in the present study we assessed the sexual partner preference (SPP) of adult male rats prenatally treated with acetaminophen (APAP), an analgesic/antipyretic drug that inhibits COX-2 and is commonly used and prescribed during pregnancy. Female rats received either saline (2 ml/kg s.c.) or APAP (50 mg/kg s.c.) every 12 h, during days 16-20 of pregnancy. At postnatal day PD60 half of the male offspring were exposed to sexual experience with receptive females during 5 trials, and the other half remained sexually naïve. At PD90 all them were tested for SPP with one sexually receptive female and one stud male. The results indicated that only APAP-naïve males failed to display SPP. However, APAP-experienced males displayed SPP for females. We discuss the effects of prenatal APAP in the disruption of unconditioned responses towards females (nature mechanisms), and the effects of sexual experience (nurture mechanisms) in the development of conditioned heterosexual preference.","execConfigId":8633,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":8662,"alertName":"PerfTest4","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Identification of Falsified Chloroquine Tablets in Africa at the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic.","authors":"[Gesa, Gnegel][Cathrin, Hauk][Richard, Neci][Georges, Mutombo][Fidelis, Nyaah][Dorothee, Wistuba][Christine, Häfele-Abah][Lutz, Heide]","assignedTo":{"id":6578,"fullName":"Admin","name":"Admin"},"publicationDate":"12-May-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"PARACETAMOL","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":8602,"articleId":"32400349","articleAbstract":"Reports that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may be effective against COVID-19 have received worldwide attention, increasing the risk of the introduction of falsified versions of these medicines.

Drug screening in X. laevis embryos is high-throughput relative to screening in rodents, potentially making them ideal for this use.

We previously developed compound-screening methods using Xenopus embryos and believe they could be used for in vitro drug-induced toxicity safety assessment before expensive preclinical trials in mammals. Specifically, Xenopus embryos could help predict drug-induced hepatotoxicity and consequently aid lead candidate prioritization. Here we present methods, which we have modified for use on Xenopus embryos, to help measure the potential for a drug to induce liver toxicity. One such method examines the release of the liver-specific microRNA (miRNA) miR-122 from the liver into the vasculature as a result of hepatocellular damage, which could be due to drug-induced acute liver injury. Paracetamol, a known hepatotoxin at high doses, can be used as a positive control. We previously showed that some of the phenotypes of mammalian paracetamol overdose are reflected in Xenopus embryos. Consequently, we have also included here a method that measures the concentration of free glutathione (GSH), which is an indicator of paracetamol-induced liver injury. These methods can be used as part of a panel of protocols to help predict the hepatoxicity of a drug at an early stage in drug development.","execConfigId":8633,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":8658,"alertName":"PerfTest4","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"The effect of intraoperative intravenous acetaminophen on intraoperative and postoperative opioid use and pain scores in minimally invasive spine surgery.","authors":"[Marie Z, Le Clair][Eugenia, Ayrian][Edward R, Mariano][Sachin, Jha]","assignedTo":{"id":6578,"fullName":"Admin","name":"Admin"},"publicationDate":"16-May-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"PARACETAMOL","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":8602,"articleId":"32428807","articleAbstract":"-","execConfigId":8633,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":8010,"alertName":"LitPerf1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Pelvic Tilt and Range of Motion in Hips With Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome.","authors":"[Rikin V, Patel][Shuyang, Han][Christopher, Lenherr][Joshua D, Harris][Philip C, Noble]","assignedTo":{"id":7435,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"15-May-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"WHO-DIAMICRON MR","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":7690,"articleId":"31599764","articleAbstract":"Physiotherapy is a management option for the treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome.

Each simulation was performed at neutral and 5° and 10° anterior and posterior pelvic tilt. Then, the hip was placed in 10° of abduction, and all simulations were repeated.With neutral pelvic tilt, impingement occurred at 4.3 ± 8.4° of IR at the high-flexion position. An increase in anterior pelvic tilt led to a loss of IR, that is, earlier occurrence of FAI, whereas an increase in posterior pelvic tilt led to an increase in IR, that is, later occurrence of FAI. At the high-flexion position, abduction provided more IR before impingement (neutral: 9.1 ± 5.7°, P < 0.01; 10° anterior tilt: 14.6 ± 5.2°, P < 0.01; 10° posterior tilt: 4.2 ± 3.7° IR, P = 0.01).

The ROM in the mid-flexion position was not affected by any combination of pelvic tilt and hip abduction or adduction (average IR: 37.4 ± 5.0°, P > 0.05).Abduction and posterior pelvic tilt increased the impingement-free ROM in the hips with FAI.

Therefore, understanding genetic factors contributing to this relationship might prove an important strategy to identify the mechanisms underlying cannabis-associated psychotic experiences. We aimed to determine how variation in AKT1, COMT and FAAH genotypes, and their interaction with three different groups (first episode psychosis (FEP) patients (n = 143), controls (n = 92) and young adult (YA) cannabis users n = 485)) influenced cannabis experiences, in those who had used cannabis at least once. We investigated the role of AKT1 (rs2494732), COMT Val158Met (rs4680) and FAAH (rs324420) on cannabis experiences by combining data from a large case-control study of FEP patients, with a naturalistic study of YA cannabis users (n = 720). Outcome measures were cannabis-induced psychotic-like experiences (cPLEs) and euphoric experiences (cEEs). We used linear mixed effects models to assess the effects of each genotype and their interaction with group, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, age of first cannabis use, years of use and frequency. cPLEs were more frequent in FEP patients than controls and YA cannabis users. cEEs were more prevalent in YA cannabis users than FEP patients or controls. Variation in AKT1, COMT or FAAH was not associated with cPLEs/cEEs. There was no interaction between genotype and group (FEP cases, controls and YA cannabis users) on cPLEs/cEEs. In conclusion, AKT1, COMT or FAAH did not modulate specific psychotomimetic response to cannabis and did not interact with group, contrary to previous research.","execConfigId":7721,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":8006,"alertName":"LitPerf1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Instigation of indigenous thermophilic bacterial consortia for enhanced oil recovery from high temperature oil reservoirs.","authors":"[Neha, Sharma][Meeta, Lavania][Vipin, Kukreti][Banwari, Lal]","assignedTo":{"id":7435,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bha

Two possible mechanisms considered included 1) envelopment by an extraneural lipoma over time, and 2) occurrence of a lipoma in the paraneurial compartment (and in this case, extension into an extraneural one).

Biofilms of EEB grown on electrodes are essential in governing the current output and power density of bioelectrochemical systems. The MR-1 genome is exceptionally dynamic due to the existence of a large number of insertion sequence (IS) elements. However, to date, the impacts of IS elements on the biofilm-forming capacity of EEB and performance of bioelectrochemical systems remain unrevealed. Herein, we isolated a non-motile mutant (NMM) with biofilm-deficient phenotype from MR-1. We found that the insertion of an ISSod2 element into the flrA (encoding the master regulator for flagella synthesis and assembly) of MR-1 resulted in the non-motile and biofilm-deficient phenotypes in NMM cells. Notably, such a variant was readily confused with the wild-type strain because there were no obvious differences in growth rates and colonial morphologies between the two strains. However, the reduced biofilm formation on the electrodes and the deteriorated performances of bioelectrochemical systems and Cr(VI) immobilization for the strain NMM were observed. Given the wide distribution of IS elements in EEB, appropriate cultivation and preservation conditions should be adopted to reduce the likelihood that IS elements-mediated mutation occurs in EEB. These findings reveal the negative impacts of IS elements on the biofilm-forming capacity of EEB and performance of bioelectrochemical systems and suggest that great attention should be given to the actual physiological states of EEB before their applications.","execConfigId":7721,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":7994,"alertName":"LitPerf1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"A Robust and Accurate Deep-Learning-based Method for the Segmentation of Subcortical Brain: Cross-dataset Evaluation of Generalization Performance.","authors":"[Naoya, Furuhashi][Shiho, Okuhata][Tetsuo, Kobayashi]","assignedTo":{"id":7435,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"11-May-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"WHO-DIAMICRON MR","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":7690,"articleId":"32389928","articleAbstract":"To analyze subcortical brain volume more reliably, we propose a deep learning segmentation method of subcortical brain based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) having high generalization performance, accuracy, and robustness.First, local images of three-dimensional (3D) bounding boxes were extracted for seven subcortical structures (thalamus, putamen, caudate, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, and accumbens) from a whole brain MR image as inputs to the neural network. Second, dilated convolution layers, which input information of variable scope, were introduced to the blocks that make up the neural network. These blocks were connected in parallel to simultaneously process global and local information obtained by the dilated convolution layers. To evaluate generalization performance, different datasets were used for training and testing sessions (cross-dataset evaluation) because subcortical brain segmentation in clinical analysis is assumed to be applied to unknown datasets.The proposed method showed better generalization performance that can obtain stable accuracy for all structures, whereas the state-of-the-art deep learning method obtained extremely low accuracy for some structures. The proposed method performed segmentation for all samples without failing with significantly higher accuracy (P < 0.005) than conventional methods such as 3D U-Net, FreeSurfer, and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain's (FMRIB's) Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL-FIRST). Moreover, when applying this proposed method to larger datasets, segmentation was robustly performed for all samples without producing segmentation results on the areas that were apparently different from anatomically relevant areas. On the other hand, FSL-FIRST produced segmentation results on the area that were apparently and largely different from the anatomically relevant area for about one-third to one-fourth of the datasets.The cross-dataset evaluation showed that the proposed method is superior to existing methods in terms of generalization performance, accuracy, and robustness.","execConfigId":7721,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":7992,"alertName":"LitPerf1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Fear and stock price bubbles.","authors":"[Thorsten, Lehnert]","assignedTo":{"id":7435,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"2020","disposition":"New","productName":"WHO-DIAMICRON MR","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":7690,"articleId":"32396567","articleAbstract":"I evaluate Alan Greenspan's claim that stock price bubbles build up in periods of euphoria and tend to burst due to increasing fear.

Inspired by this evidence, I construct an euphoria/fear index, which is based on an economic model of time varying risk aversion. Based on US industry returns 1959-2014, my findings suggest that (1) Greenspan is correct in that the price run-up initially occurs in periods of euphoria followed by a crash due to increasing fear; (2) on average already roughly a year before an industry is crashing, euphoria is turning into fear, while the market is still bullish; (3) there is no particular euphoria-fear-pattern for price-runs in industries that do not subsequently crash.

Using mass cytometry to simultaneously measure multiple signalling pathways during activation of murine CD8+ T cells, we found a programme of distal signalling events that is shared, regardless of the strength of TCR stimulation. Moreover, the relationship between transcription of early response genes Nr4a1 and Irf8 and activation of the ribosomal protein S6 is also conserved across stimuli. Instead, we found that stimulation strength dictates the rate with which cells initiate signalling through this network.
